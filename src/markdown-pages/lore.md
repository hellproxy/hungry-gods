## Elves

To say something briefly about elves, then, there are some elves who have become part of the wider society of their respective territories much in the same way as humans or dwarves or orcs have. Then there are elves who live in their isolated communities under separate, independent political rule (a bit like how it’s supposed to work together with the native Americans).

### Communities

The main elven polities that exist in the setting separate from the powers that be are:

#### Al-Meera

An elven famous for its artisans and craftspeople. It is build into the walls of a deep valley (think Petra in Jordan) in the western end of the Ilmayyid Ulemanate. There are very few full elves that live there, with most people being half or quarter elven.

#### Al-Raqq

Al Raqq was a great elven centre of learning, culture and of the magical arts in the middle of what is now the Desert of Hungry Gods but was destroyed over 700 years ago when then moon was fractured and shards of it fell to earth leaving the city in ruins. Some of the survivors fled to the surrounding non-elven cities while others began the impossible task of rebuilding the spired city to its former glory.

#### Al-Kardur

The city of tents. The elves of Al-Kardur are nomads, moving through the desert from place to place without settling in any one location for long. They are staunch traditionalists, preferring to minimalist their interactions with non-elves.

#### Al-Rith

The eastern-most - and largest- of the elven polities hidden in the mountains of the Zodiac Empire. A nation of philosophers who’s culture focuses on finding oneness with nature.

## Halflings

So across the continent, whether in the Ulemanate or the Zodiac Empire, halflings have integrated into the mixed communities of humans, dwarves, goblins, orcs, elves and many other races that make up those societies.

Unlike Dwarves, however, who lost and forgot their ancestry, halflings - who had originally been pastoral nomads some many millennia ago - maintained their rich network of traditions wherever they went.

### Communities

Even within the cities of the great nations, and acknowledging always the power structures above them, halflings formed tight-knit communities, often establishing a ‘halfling quarter’. Commmunity Matters were then settled by the council of elders rather than appealing to other authorities, with the general authorities only being relied upon to deal with matters outside the community (I.e. where a crime is perpetrated against a halfling by a non-halfling.

### Culture

Halflings are particularly proud of their hair, keeping it clean and wearing a number of (often quite elaborate) ornaments in it which signal or symbolise certain achievements of the individual, milestones in their lives and other markers of identity. One particular marker, worn by almost all adult halflings, is awarded on the completion of a one year period of wandering and exile undertaken by all halflings as they come of edge - to recognise and remember the halfling history as nomads. The halflings are also great tellers of stories and singers of songs (theirs being an oral culture originally) and a halfling will often use this period of exile to gather stories and songs of their travel to share and impress when they return home.

### Religion

Nomadic halflings typically worshipped nature spirits and, on moving into the cities, household spirits (the spirit of the hearth, the doorway, the kitchen etc - like Slavic Domovoi) they did not have any specific gods but rather folk heroes who’s famous exploits became mythologised over many generations

In the Ilmayyid Ulemanate, where no form of open religion is tolerated, halflings are careful to present these stories and beliefs as elements of a mythological history, and prayers to the household spirits are a rushed and secretive affair.

Things are more relaxed in the Zodiac Empire, where certain of the halflings folk heroes have been accepted into the state pantheon of 10,000 deities at varying ranks. Worship of household spirits is tolerated, provided that it is dressed up as appeasing the spirits rather than prayer to a divinity.

Halflings among the northern tribes of the Khiterai confederacy, live nomadic lives much like their ancestors worshiping the spirits of nature as well as the wild gods of the Khiterai pantheon.
