## Elves

The main elven polities that exist in the setting separate from the powers that be are:

### Al-Meera

An elven famous for its artisans and craftspeople. It is build into the walls of a deep valley (think Petra in Jordan) in the western end of the Ilmayyid Ulemanate. There are very few full elves that live there, with most people being half or quarter elven.

### Al-Raqq

Al Raqq was a great elven centre of learning, culture and of the magical arts in the middle of what is now the Desert of Hungry Gods but was destroyed over 700 years ago when then moon was fractured and shards of it fell to earth leaving the city in ruins. Some of the survivors fled to the surrounding non-elven cities while others began the impossible task of rebuilding the spired city to its former glory.

### Al-Kardur

The city of tents. The elves of Al-Kardur are nomads, moving through the desert from place to place without settling in any one location for long. They are staunch traditionalists, preferring to minimalist their interactions with non-elves.

### Al-Rith

The eastern-most - and largest- of the elven polities hidden in the mountains of the Zodiac Empire. A nation of philosophers whoâ€™s culture focuses on finding oneness with nature.
