One particular marker, worn by almost all adult halflings, is awarded on the completion of a one year period of wandering and exile undertaken by all halflings as they come of edge - to recognise and remember the halfling history as nomads. The halflings are also great tellers of stories and singers of songs (theirs being an oral culture originally) and a halfling will often use this period of exile to gather stories and songs of their travel to share and impress when they return home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"religion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#religion\" aria-label=\"religion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Religion</h3>\n<p>Nomadic halflings typically worshipped nature spirits and, on moving into the cities, household spirits (the spirit of the hearth, the doorway, the kitchen etc - like Slavic Domovoi) they did not have any specific gods but rather folk heroes who’s famous exploits became mythologised over many generations</p>\n<p>In the Ilmayyid Ulemanate, where no form of open religion is tolerated, halflings are careful to present these stories and beliefs as elements of a mythological history, and prayers to the household spirits are a rushed and secretive affair.</p>\n<p>Things are more relaxed in the Zodiac Empire, where certain of the halflings folk heroes have been accepted into the state pantheon of 10,000 deities at varying ranks.
